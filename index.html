      <h1>Application Description</h1>
      <p>Our application will be a revolutionary platform that allows users to customize their computer or device using song lyrics, song images, and customization options. It will be similar to Rainmeter or Lively Wallpaper, but with additional features related to music and song lyrics. We aim to offer a unique experience where users can not only listen to music but also interact with it by creating custom themes where each song lyric and image becomes part of the user's screen experience.</p>

      <h1>Planned Features</h1>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Song Lyrics Animations</strong><br> Each song will be displayed with animations where the lyrics appear on the screen, allowing users to follow along with the song. Animations will be varied â€“ for example, text movement, fading, popping up, etc. Users will be able to choose from different animation styles to make their experience unique.</li>
        <li><strong>Custom Theme Editors</strong><br> We will offer users the ability to create their own custom themes. These themes can include different fonts, colors, images, and animation styles. Using a "drag-and-drop" interface, users will be able to easily add elements and configure how the song lyrics and images will appear on the screen.</li>
        <li><strong>Song Counters and Triggers</strong><br> Song Counters: Users will be able to set a specific number of songs after which the computer will perform a specific action. For example, after five songs are played, the computer could shut down or go into sleep mode. This feature will allow users to customize their computer based on their preferences.
            Triggers: Each user will be able to add different "song triggers" that perform actions when certain songs are played. For example, the computer could start talking or execute certain actions when specific words or phrases appear in the song.</li>
        <li><strong>Theme Library</strong><br> The app will offer pre-made themes (e.g., Christmas, Halloween, modern style, etc.), which users can select and customize for their music experience. These themes will be available for easy customization, offering different visual and animation options.</li>
        <li><strong>Sharing and Collaboration</strong><br> Users will be able to create their own custom themes and share them with others. Other users will be able to download the theme and customize it according to their needs. There will also be an option to rate themes, suggest improvements, and even earn money from sharing them.</li>
        <li><strong>User Feedback and Ratings</strong><br> Themes and ideas will be based on user feedback and ratings. Themes that receive high ratings will be highlighted so that other users can easily find and use them.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive Text and Customizations</strong><br> Users will be able to not only view song lyrics but also manipulate them by adding various effects. For example, adding text that moves up or down the screen, or accumulates after a set time of the song.</li>
        <li><strong>Voting on Theme Improvements</strong><br> Users will be able to suggest improvements or corrections to the way song lyrics are displayed. This could involve grammar and design fixes, as well as adding interactive elements.</li>
      </ul>
